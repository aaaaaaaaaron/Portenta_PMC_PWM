# Portenta_PMC_PWM Library

This Library is a fork from [khoih-prog's Portenta_H7_PWM library](https://github.com/khoih-prog/Portenta_H7_PWM). All I did was update some pin definitions to make it work on my Portenta Machine Control. View that repo for much more helpful information! I forked the original repo rather than submitting a PR because it is not being mantained anymore.

I would say be careful when using this because it is not tested very well. And be mindful of managing your PWM instances.

I may submit it to the library manager sometime.



## Installation


### Manual Install

Another way to install is to:

1. Navigate to [**Portenta_H7_PWM**](https://github.com/khoih-prog/Portenta_H7_PWM) page.
2. Download the latest release `Portenta_H7_PWM-main.zip`.
3. Extract the zip file to `Portenta_H7_PWM-main` directory 
4. Copy whole `Portenta_H7_PWM-main` folder to Arduino libraries' directory such as `~/Arduino/libraries/`.
